LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Networks
A Project Presented to The Faculty of the Department of Computer Science at Cornell College

In Partial Fulfillment for the Degree of Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science 

by Angel Fabila, Jiashu Wang, and Yuzhe Zheng

## Abstract
LSTM Neural Networks depend on the historical context of their inputs; however, they also reach a point when they are likely to be less dependent on their past experiences. LSTM Neural Networks learn when to remember and when to forget (Moawad, 2018). 
Applications of LSTM Neural Networks include text generation, music generation, language translation, and image captioning. Our goal is to create a chatbot consisting of LSTM Neural Networks using libraries such as Numpy and Keras.
